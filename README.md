## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rick Moore, and you've stumbled onto my GitHub page!  Feel free to take a look around!

I'm a software engineer and web developer, with a passion for working with superstar teams to create new and innovative technology.  I recently graduated from the online software engineering program at Flatiron School, and I'm looking for work in the tech industry.

My main stack consists of:
* ReactJS
* Redux
* JavaScript
* Ruby on Rails
* HTML5
* CSS3

I love learning new technologies and finding creative solutions to problems.  Check out the codebases for my project below, including a task management/team delegation application, a pdf sheet-music sharing application, a quiz generation application, and a playable virtual instrument.
